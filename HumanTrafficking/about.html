<p>Human trafficking, also called trafficking in persons, form of modern-day slavery 
involving the illegal transport of individuals by force or deception for the purpose of
labour, sexual exploitation, or activities in which others benefit financiag in personslly. 
Human trafficking is a global problem affecting people of all ages.It is estimated that
approximately 1,000,000 people are trafficked each year globally and that between 20,000
and 50,000 are trafficked into the United States, which is one of the largest destinations
for victims of the sex-trafficking trade.</p>

     <p>In RESCUE.orG,we try to help people to raise their voice against human trafficking.We 
ensure that they get help and support related to their issue.We measures to  provide 
for the physical,psychological and social recovery of victims of trafficking.</p>
     <p>Our organisation takes regulatory steps to increase awareness of the risks of human
 trafficking, specially amaong individuals intending to migrate.Health care providers and organisations involved with trafficked persons should increase their capacity to identify and refer people in trafficking situations and provide sensitive and safe services to people post trafficking.</p></div>

<h2 class="text-left">What Can I Do?</h2></div>
<div class="py-2">
<hr class="w-25" align="left"></div>
<div><p>The organization advocates for stronger federal and state laws, operates the National Human Trafficking Resource Center hotline, provides services and support for trafficking victims, and works with survivors to develop long-term strategies to ending human trafficking.
We also love connecting with  the organisations that are fighting human trafficking.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create  platform for victims who are facing human trafficking.We also provide a platform who want to work against human trafficking.The opportunities for the public to take action are always specific and measurable. Because we partner with organizations working on the ground, our initiatives impact hotspots throughout the world.
<P>Through this, we are building a community of activists that can come alongside the lawyers, law enforcement and service providers to not just address the victims and consequences of slavery, but to truly end the practice.</P>
