This project is an attempt to bring to light the issue of human trafficking. It is our attempt towards creating a platform for awareness for such issues and involving volunteers for such crimes happening around us.
The branch HumanTrafficking has files "index.html" , "contact-us.html" , "registration.html" and "about.html" which are contain the HTML for our webpage.
It has a folder "images" that contains all the related images for the webpage.
